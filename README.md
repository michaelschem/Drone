Drone
=====

Drone project for senior design using TI Chip CC3200


1.1 OPENCV CODE
-----

I. Install Continuum Analytics Anaconda Python Distribution for Python 2.7

  1. Install Guide: http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html

  2. Note: Comes with Spyder IDE, so you don't need to get one seperately


II. Install OpenCV

  1. Tutorial: http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/doc/py_tutorials/py_setup/py_setup_in_windows/py_setup_in_windows.html#install-opencv-python-in-windows

  2. Note: I used the Precompiled binaries

  3. Note: FFMPEG is an important 3rd party library for video manipulation in OpenCV but may not install properly after following the above tutorial. I
  spent a fair amount of time messing with FFMPEG before I go it working, and I
  will add as coherent a tutorial as possible if I can.

1.2 Energia
-----

The Energia libraries are the code behind the primary operation of the CC3200 chip.  Documentation and installation instructions can be found at energuia.nu.
